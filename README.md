# dotosb-abstraction
My WIP library to abstract some stuff in the dotosb library for osu! storyboarding.<br>
The files i work on are in `/src`
# How to use it
First of all put `sbCommands.js` inside the same folder of `event.js` and `sprite.js` (which is in `/src` if you haven't done any modification).<br>
Then import it as in the `example.js` (change the paths if needed), and then you can call/use any function, class or variable just by writing their name.<br>
Inside the variable `easings` there is a list of all the easings mapped to their corresponding integer value in the .osb commands format.
