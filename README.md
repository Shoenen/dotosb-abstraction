# dotosb-abstraction
My WIP library to abstract some stuff in the dotosb library for osu! storyboarding
The files i work on are in `src`
# How to use it
First of all put `sbCommands.js` inside the same folder of `event.js` (which is in `src` if you haven't done any modification).<br>
Then import it as in the `example.js` (you can use any name for it, i've used and will use `sc` as an example), and then, to call any function inside this library, do `sc.functionYouWantToCall(...)`.
Inside `sc.easings` there is a list of all the easings.
